# AI Safety Events Tracker

The AI Safety Events Tracker is a system designed to find, classify, and store events related to AI safety from diverse web sources. This is for [aisafety.events](https://aisafety.events/).

The aim is to automate the aggregation work, enabling a team to curate the discovered events, and to integrate selected ones into a public database. Perhaps it could be fully automated one day.
